Our third Beenie Video, the shoot got smoother and was a part of a very eventful production month. We shot Green-Screen with a clear idea in mind of what graphic treatment we wanted to give it. The Blackberry Scene however was a last minute consideration after the inspiration came to me the night before it was due. I am happy with the outcome and having getting good feedback. Check it out.
