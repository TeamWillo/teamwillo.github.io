Team Willo was called in about 2 months after the video was shot to bring closure to the video, with edit and graphics adjustments according to client request. The original editor on the video was Jahdean van Gogh who did some good work on the animation plates. I would have done some things differently but I'd like to attempt it from scratch on a future project. It's a nice song thoughâ€¦Enjoy.
