TWP has been quiet for a bit, but it doesn't mean that things have been quiet at TWP. Red Amber and Green had taken up a lot of our time last quarter. The Director, Christopher Byfield enlisted our help for the scoring (musical accompaniment) and the editing (inclusive of colouring) of the film. Plot arcs are important to the process of making edit decisions, introducing the characters properly, spending only enough time in their environment for you to get to know them so when they relate to other actors you can believe why they are doing what they do. The director should always capture lots of b-roll footage of the environment, close-ups on secondary actions and reactions of supporting characters to give the editor enough material to create a texture and a feel of the scene because if we are observing a scene in real life we do not just see the actors in their performance but or attention is diverted to other little things in the environment that immerse us further in the story, so that when something big does happen in the plot we feel more of an impact from it. The process of helping to tell this story was a creatively rewarding experience for all involved. Share it with us as the 18-minute short film will air throughout the entire month of January 2012 on Flow 100 Wednesdays at 8:30pm, Fridays at 9:30pm and Sundays at 6:30pm. The film will be preceded by an interview of Chris Byfield and Winston Wilkins, the editor. Let us know what you think of our effort. We look forward to your feedback.
