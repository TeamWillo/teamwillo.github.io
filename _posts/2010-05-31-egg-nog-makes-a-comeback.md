  Egg Nog has presented us a new single called "Chat". All the raw footage was shot against a roughly lit green screen and no concept was presented other than a girl being beaten up by her man, while out on the street he tries to role with the other bad boys. I used transitions to try to keep it interesting and coloured it so it looked good on television.

Egg Nog has presented us a new single called "Chat". All the raw footage was shot against a roughly lit green screen and no concept was presented other than a girl being beaten up by her man, while out on the street he tries to role with the other bad boys. I used transitions to try to keep it interesting and coloured it so it looked good on television.

The bad greenscreen and wardrobe colour decision on the critical Spragga Benz Cameos made keying difficult and we see white backgrounds in some of the shots.

The client now see the value of having us on set to guide the green screen setups.

We have gotten good feedback from other entertainers who now want us to handle the graphics in their video and we are getting a lot of airplay in Jamaica for this video. So it worked out after all.
