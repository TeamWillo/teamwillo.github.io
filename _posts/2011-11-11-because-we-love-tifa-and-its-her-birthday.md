Tifa asked TWP to do her Birthday Party Commercial for her and since it has been some time since we'd done a motion graphics project we jumped at the opportunity. Camille Robinson inspired the motion graphics with the flyer she designed and Marvin Bartley did a nice job photographing Tifa. Instead of timing the animation of the elements to the beat of the song like you would in a music video, We timed it to the words she was saying. Let us know what you think of the piece.
