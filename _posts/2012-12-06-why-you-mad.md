Team Willo got caught in the middle of this controversial tune which seems to be lashing out at Lady Saw. Whether Tifa and Spice are justified or not I am proud of the colour grading and editing work that went into this video. God Bless the Red, White and Blue… and the pinks greens and yellows in this video. Notice we kept the skin tones in tact.
