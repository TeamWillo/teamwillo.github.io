Dexter "3D" Pottinger and Team Willo Productions prepared this Video for the 2011 JCDC Festival Song Competition. The budget, time and manpower was limited but we were able to pull it off (editing included) in one weekend in multiple locations. I'd like to take on more projects like this. It's like flying by the seat of your pants.
