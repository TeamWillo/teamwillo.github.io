So Kartel approached Janelle Dyer (Director) to do the video for his collaboration with Sheba â€“ "Like Christmas". To be honest, we saw this as an opportunity to buss the song with the video. We shot everything in 60 frames per sec. on the Canon EOS 7D. and we brought our trusty portable greenscreen apparatus to a townhouse in the Allerdyce area in Kingston.

We used the Green Screen to Composite slow motion shots with realtime performance shots and white balanced the footage to get rid of the reddish tones we tend to get while using warm lights on the 7D. The Winter wonderland scene was shot in reference to some pics we downloaded a few days we downloaded and we set up the shot against a greenscreen we set up on this lawn at 4 in the morning. The Greenscreen extracts were clean and the final edit told a smooth story. I am very proud of the work the team did on this one and the ambitious effects we attempted has created a gateway for bigger and better concepts in future. We'll keep you posted.
