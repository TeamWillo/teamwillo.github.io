I saw the Collide video some time ago. The shooting style I thought was a bit different from from what I've come to expect from Fareye Films. In time past Fareye films has done some great work but it was mostly for slower paced songs, reflected also in the editing which captured, the beautiful details of the environments shot, and especially the emotions of the subjects shot. In the last few videos by Fareye films however, we are seeing a lot more details in each scene captured and then displayed in the editing almost as if there are more hours in the production day. Actually what we see are less performance scenes being shot and detailed skit shots in each scene which still makes for an interesting edit. It also helps that Bliko Cuervo does the editing as well as the Cinematography, influencing shot decisions made on the production day. I like the change of direction Fareye Films and commend Bliko Cuervo and some really nice work. Check out also these other videos done recently with Fareye Films which have employed the same principles described above.
