Normally I don't like how Tingle (DP) shoots, very dark and moody. Doesn't allow for much colour manipulation. However in this case it didn't come out that bad. What I did was colour the dark shots first analyze the grain and saturation in the footage and then match the daytime outdoor footage to the indoor footage â€“ film grain and all. Other considerations: Shot with Sony EX3/lens mount and an assortment of nikon lenses were used for the shallow depth of field.
