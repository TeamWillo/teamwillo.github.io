Cricket, lovely Cricket. I'm not fan, really, but the twenty over format is growing on me. We did this TV show for airing on TVJ (one of the National Stations in Jamaica) promoting the newly formed ‘Jamaica Premier League'. The focus was more on the sights, sounds and interviews. You can get this edit package as a ‘complete feature for web/tv placement' on the <figure><a href="/faq/production-services/micro-feature-edit/" title="micro feature edit" target="_blank">micro feature edit</a></figure> page. A minimum of 6 episodes is required to include Motion Graphics and Shooting of Links.
