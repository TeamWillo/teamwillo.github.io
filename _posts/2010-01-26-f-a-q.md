Q: How much does it cost to get a good music video done?

A: Generally about US$4500 allows us to execute most of the storylines we propose. A lot of people say "I only have $2000, can I just get a simple video?" The truth is that what you spend shows in the production and if we put our name on it then everyone loses.

Q: How much does it cost to edit a music video?

A: See our remote solutions page

Q: How long does it take to edit a music video?

A: About two weeks for a regular video and 4 weeks for a graphics intensive video, not because it takes the full four weeks, but because we like to keep revisiting the video with fresh eyes. It takes about 8 to 20 hrs depending on complexity when you add up all the time, but it is never worth it to rush the process.

Q: Do we distribute the music videos to TV stations once they are done?

A: This depends. Some Artistes are easier to distribute than others. However, because of our consistent quality â€“ Media house from the Caribbean, North America, Africa and Asia look forward to our latest releases.
