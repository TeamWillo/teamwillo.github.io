So Melloquence first video has a fire scene in it that I'm pretty proud of. I used Mesh Warping on the fire as it conforms to her body â€“ which by the way was shoot on a black background and the girl was painted black, so the light on her only showed her contours. NO GIRLS WERE BURNED IN THIS SHOOT. The fire was shot separately in various shapes and sizes and then composited to the girl later. We used a panasonic P2 to film the shots. I like the edit outcome, but I think the artist has better songs in his catalogue he could have done a debut video for.
