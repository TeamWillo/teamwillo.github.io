I came across an article in the Pulitzer Prize Winning Huffington Post website. The writer was reviewing the Barbados Carib Tales film festival. Before you read the article it is worth noting that Red Amber and Green has won 3 awards so far:  
- The Lignum Vitae Film Festival. (Best Director)  
- The Reggae Film Festival. (Best Overall Film)  
- Carib Tales Film Festival (Best Short Film) 

There are a few more upcoming festivals in the next few months. Wish us Luck!!!
