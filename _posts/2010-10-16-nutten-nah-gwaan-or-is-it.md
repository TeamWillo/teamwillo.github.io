We did this video for was and Raine and the concept of the video was, a picture shift between uptown and downtown people struggles, and at the end we realise it's all parts of a bigger picture. Shooting considerations were planned so that shots fell into place in the story when edited. Shot in the panasonic P2. Big up Jeremy Rogers (DP) his work is so fresh and clean!
