Dexter 3D Pottinger and Tifa approached me to edit this video and as the years go by she gets more and more daring. Speeding up shots, freeze framing and colour effects in FCP make for an interesting treatment but what I really focused on where the white shirt graphics which consisted of text in some places and hand drawn animation, prepared and digitized with a homemade lightbox and a blackberry camera, and then used AE to superimpose on the shirts. and manually motion-tracked. I like the outcome. I hope you do too.
